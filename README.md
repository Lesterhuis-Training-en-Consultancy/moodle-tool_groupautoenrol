# Moodle-admin_tool_groupautoenrol

Version 3.9.0 (stable version) for Moodle 3.9.0

Plugin to randomly auto enrol students in Moodle courses groups when they are enrolled into the course (whatever the enrol methods : auto-enrol by key, cohorts sync or manual enrol)

## Things to know :
- The plugin uses \core\event\user_enrolment_created (user_enrolled) Moodle event
- If a selected group is deleted, the plugin will ignore it.

## In this stable version (3.9.0) :
- GDPR implementation
- you can choose to enable the plugin in each course
- you can choose to auto-enrol students in all existing course or specific ones

## Compatibility :
- Tested with Moodle 3.9
- Another version of the plugin exist and works with Moodle 2.5 and 2.7 (I did not test it with the others versions but should work with all 2.x).
It's a local plugin because adding link into "Course administration" menu was not possible for admin tool before Moodle 3.0

# Installation
* Copy the directory 'groupautoenrol' into the `moodledir/admin/tool` directory.
* Connect to moodle as an administrator and install the plugin.
* Go to a course, create at least one group
* Enable the plugin for the course with the new link "Course administration > Users > Auto-enrol in groups"
Note : this link appears even if the plugin is not enabled for the course
